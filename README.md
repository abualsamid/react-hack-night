# react-hack-night

This is a project for me to learn react during React-hack-night in Orlando Dev Ops.

It is a bot that learns from the user.

The user starts by chatting the bot, but the poor bot does not understand anything.

The user then can teach the bot using this syntax.

/learn "Something to Learn" /reply "This is what you say back"

The bot then would reply with "This is what you say back" the next time it hears "Something to learn"

#TODO

1. Save to a back end database.

2. Use regex to learn more stuff.

3. tie to a backend NL service.
